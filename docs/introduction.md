Preaction Inputs is a small library of React components targeting Bootstrap v5. The primary intention of this project is to reduce the markup needed for commonly used elements such as alerts, cards, navigation menus, top-level boilerplates, and more. It is not intended to be a replacement for react-bootstrap.
