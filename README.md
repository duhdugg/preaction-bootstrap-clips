# Preaction Boostrap Clips

This is a small library of React components targeting Bootstrap v4. The primary intention of this project is to reduce the markup needed for commonly used elements such as alerts, cards, navigation menus, top-level boilerplates, and more.

It is under active development and the full scope of this project is pending determination.
